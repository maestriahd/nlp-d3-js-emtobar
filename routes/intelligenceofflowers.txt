THE INTELLIGENCE OF 
THE FLOWERS - 







THE INTELLIGENCE 

OF 

THE FLOWERS 
I 

1 WISH merely to recall 
here a few facts known to 
every botanist. I have 
made not a single discovery 
and my modest contribu- 
tion is confined to a few 
elementary observations. I 
need hardly say that I have 
no intention of reviewing 
all the proofs of intelligence 
which the plants give us. 
These proofs are innumer- 
able and continual, espe- 
cially among the flowers, in 
which the effort of vegetable 
life towards light and under- 
standing is concentrated. 



-i-8-> 



Though there be plants 
and flowers that are awk- 
ward or unlucky, there is 
none that is wholly devoid 
of wisdom and ingenuity. 
All exert themselves to 
accomplish their work, all 
have the magnificent am- 
bition to overrun and con- 
quer the surface of the 
globe by endlessly multiply- 
ing that form of existence 
which they represent. To 
attain this object, they have, 
because of the law that 
chains them to the soil, to 
overcome difficulties much 
greater than those opposed 
to the increase of the ani- 
mals. And therefore the 
majority of them have re- 
course to combinations, to 



-£-()">- 



a machinery, to traps 
which, in regard to such 
matters as mechanism, bal- 
listics, aerial navigation and 
the observation of insects, 
have often anticipated the 
inventions and acquire- 
ments of man. 

II 

It would be superfluous 
once more to trace the 
picture of the great systems 
of floral fertilization : the 
play of stamens and pistil, 
the seduction of perfumes, 
the appeal of harmonious 
and dazzling colours, the 
concoction of nectar, which 
is absolutely useless to the 
flower and is manufactured 
only to attract and retain 



-f- IO-> 



the liberator from without, 
the messenger of love — 
bee, humble-bee, fly, but- 
terfly or moth — that is to 
bring to the flower the kiss 
of the distant, invisible, 
motionless lover. . . . 

This vegetable world, 
which to us appears so 
placid, so resigned, in 
which all seems acquies- 
cence, silence, obedience, 
meditation, is, on the con- 
trary, that in which the 
revolt against destiny is 
the most vehement and the 
most stubborn. The essen- 
tial organ, the nutrient organ 
of the plant, its root, at- 
taches it indissolubly to 
the soil. If it be difficult 
to discover among the great 



-§- II -> 



laws that oppress us that 
which weighs heaviest upon 
our shoulders, in the case 
of the plant there is no 
doubt : it is the law that 
condemns it to immobility 
from its birth to its death. 
Therefore it knows better 
than we, who disseminate 
our efforts, against what 
first to rise in rebellion. 
And the energy of its fixed 
idea, mounting from the 
darkness of the roots to be- 
come organized and full- 
blown in the light of the 
flower, is an incomparable 
spectacle. It exerts itself 
wholly with one object : to 
escape above from the fatal- 
ity below, to evade, to trans- 
gress the heavy and sombre 



-*- I2-> 



law, to set itself free, to 
shatter the narrow sphere, 
to invent or invoke wings, 
to escape as far as it can, to 
conquer the space in which 
destiny encloses it, to ap- 
proach another kingdom, to 
penetrate into a moving and 
active world. ... Is the 
fact that it attains its object 
not as surprising as though 
we were to succeed in living 
outside the time which a 
different destiny assigns to 
us or in making our way 
into a universe freed from 
the weightiest laws of mat- 
ter ? We shall see that the 
flower sets man a prodig- 
ious example of insubmis- 
sion, courage, perseverance 
and ingenuity. If we had 



•*- 13-> 



applied to the removal of 
various necessities that 
crush us, such as pain, old 
age and death, one half of 
the energy displayed by any 
little flower in our gardens, 
we may well believe that 
our lot would be very differ- 
ent from what it is. 
» 

III 

This need of movement, 
this craving for space, 
• among the greater number 
of plants, is manifested in 
both the flower and the 
fruit. It is easily explained 
in the fruit, or, in any case, 
discloses only a less complex 
experience and foresight. 
Contrary to that which 
takes place in the animal 



-*-i4-*- 



kingdom and because of the 
terrible law of absolute im- 
mobility, the chief and 
worst enemy of the seed is 
the paternal stock. We are 
in a strange world, where 
the parents, unable to move 
from place to place, know 
that they are condemned to 
starve or stifle their off- 
spring. Every seed that 
falls at the joot of tEeTtree 
or plant is either lost or 
doomed to sprout in wretch- ( 
edness . Hence the immense 
effort to throw off the yoke 
and conquer space. Hence 
the marvellous systems of 
dissemination, of propul- 
sion, of navigation of the 
air which we find on every 
side in the forest and the 



-£- l5-> 



plain: among others, to 
mention, in passing, but a 
few of the most curious, the 
aerial screw or samara of 
the Maple; the bract of 
the Lime-tree; the flying- 
machine of the Thistle, the 
Dandelion and the Salsafy ; 
the detonating springs of 
the Spurge ; the extraordi- 
nary squirt of the Momor- 
dica ; the hooks of the 
eriophilous plants ; and a 
thousand other unexpected 
and astounding pieces of 
mechanism ; for there is 
not, so to speak, a single 
seed but has invented for 
its sole use a complete 
method of escaping from 
the maternal shade. 

It would, in fact, be 



-r- i6~&» 



impossible, if one had not 
practised a little botany, to 
believe the expenditure of 
imagination and genius in 
all the verdure that glad- 
dens our eyes. Consider, 
for instance, the charming 
seedpots of the Scarlet 
Pimpernel, the five valves 
of the Balsam, the five 
bursting capsules of the 
Geranium. Do not forget, 
upon occasion, to examine 
the common Poppy-head, 
which we find at any her- 
balist's. This good, big 
head shelters a prudence 
and a foresight that deserve 
the highest praise. We 
know that it holds thou- 
sands of the tiniest black 
seeds. Its object is to scatter 



-*- 17-*- 



this seed as dexterously 
and to as great a distance 
as possible. If the capsule 
containing it were to split, 
to fall or to open under- 
neath, the precious black 
dust would form but a use- 
less heap at the foot of the 
stalk. But its only outlet 
is through apertures con- 
trived right at the top of 
the capsule, which, when 
ripe, bends over on its 
peduncle, sways like a cen- 
ser at the least breath of 
wind and literally sows 
the seeds in space, with 
the very action employed 
by the sower. 

Shall I speak of the seeds 
which provide for their 



-e- i8-> 



dissemination by birds and 
which, to entice them, as 
in the case of the Mistletoe, 
the Juniper, the Mountain- 
ash, lurk inside a sweet 
husk? We see here dis- 
played such a powerful 
reasoning faculty, such a 
remarkable understanding 
of final causes that we 
hardly dare dwell upon the 
subject, for fear of repeat- 
ing the ingenuous mistakes 
of Bernardin de Saint- 
Pierre. And yet the facts 
can be no otherwise ex- 
plained. The sweet husk 
is of no more use to the 
seed than the nectar, which 
attracts the bees, is to the 
flower. The bird eats the 
fruit because it is sweet 



•*- 19"> 



and, at the same time, 
swallows the seed, which 
is indigestible. He flies 
away and, soon after, ejects 
the seed in the same con- 
dition in which he has 
received it, but stripped 
of its case and ready to 
sprout far from the attend- 
ant dangers of its birth- 
place. 

IV 

But let us return to 
simpler contrivances. Pick 
a blade of grass by the road- 
side, from the first tuft that 
offers, and you will perceive 
an independent, indefati- 
gable, unexpected little in- 
telligence at work. Here, 
for instance, are two poor 



<~ao~%- 



creeping plants which you 
have met a thousand times 
on your walks, for we find 
them in every spot, down 
to the most ungrateful cor- 
ners to which a pinch of 
soil has strayed. They 
are two varieties of wild 
Lucern or Medick (Medi- 
cago), two "ill weeds" in 
the humblest sense of the 
word. One bears a red- 
dish flower, the other a 
little yellow ball of the size 
of a pea. To see them 
crawling and hiding among 
the proud grasses, one 
would never suspect that, 
long before the illustrious 
geometrician and physician 
of Syracuse, they had dis- 
covered the Archimedean 



f 



screw and endeavoured to 
apply it not to the raising 
of liquids, but to the art 
of flying. They lodge their 
seeds in light spirals with 
three or four convolutions, 
admirably constructed to 
delay their fall and, conse- 
quently, with the help of 
the wind, to prolong their 
journey through the air. 
One of them, the yellow, 
has even improved upon 
the apparatus of the red by 
furnishing the edges of the 
spiral with a double row 
of spikes, with the evident 
intention of hooking it, on 
its passage, to either the 
clothes of the pedestrians 
or the fleece of the animals. 
It clearly hopes to add the 



-S-22-J- 



advantages of eriophily — 
that is to say the dissemi- 
nation of seed by sheep, 
goats, rabbits and so on 
— to those of anemophily, 
or dissemination by the 
wind. 

The most touching side 
of this great effort is its 
futility. The poor red and 
yellow Lucerns have blun- 
dered. Their remarkable 
screws are of no use to 
them: they could act only 
if they fell from a certain 
height, from the top of 
some lofty tree or tall 
Graminea; but, constructed 
as they are on the level 
of the grass, they have 
hardly taken a quarter of 
a turn before already they 



~l-23-§» 



touch the ground. We 
have here a curious in- 
stance of the mistakes, 
the gropings, the experi- 
ments and the frequent 
little miscalculations of 
nature; for only those 
who have studied nature 
but very little will maintain 
that she never errs. 

Let us observe, in pass- 
ing, that other varieties of 
the Lucern (not to speak 
of the Clover, another 
papilionaceous Leguminosa, 
almost identical with that 
of which we are now 
speaking) have not adopted 
this flying apparatus, but 
keep to the primitive 
methods of the pod. In 
one of them, the Medicago 



-*-24-S- 



aurantiaca, we very clearly 
perceive the transition from 
the twisted pod to the screw 
or spiral. Another variety, 
the Medicago scuttellata, or 
Snail-medick, rounds its 
screw in the form of a ball. 
It would seem, therefore, 
that we are assisting at the 
stimulating spectacle of a 
sort of work of invention, 
at the attempts of a family 
that has not yet settled 
its destiny and is seeking 
for the best way of ensur- 
ing its future. Was it 
not perhaps, in the course 
of this search that, hav- 
ing been deceived in the 
spiral, the yellow Lucern 
added spikes or hooks to 
it, saying to itself, not 



-*-25-> 



unreasonably, that, since its 
leaves attract the sheep, 
it is inevitable and right 
that the sheep should 
assume the care of its 
progeny? And, lastly, is 
it not thanks to this new 
effort and to this happy 
thought that the Lucern 
with the yellow flowers is 
infinitely more widely dis- 
tributed than its sturdier 
cousin whose flowers are 
red? 



It is not only in the 
seed or the flower, but in 
the whole plant, leaves, 
stalks and roots, that we 
discover, if we stoop for a 
moment over their humble 



-«£-26-> 



work, many traces of a 
prudent and quick intelli- 
gence. Think of the mag- 
nificent struggle towards 
the light of the thwarted 
branches, or the ingenious 
and courageous strife of 
trees in danger. As for 
myself, I shall never for- 
get the admirable example 
of heroism given me the 
other day in Provence, in 
the wild and delightful 
gorges of the Loup, all 
fragrant with violets, by 
a huge centenarian Laurel- 
tree. It was easy to read 
on its twisted and, so to 
speak, writhing trunk the 
whole drama of its hard 
and tenacious life. A bird 
or the wind, masters of 



-t-2 7~*- 



destiny both, had carried 
the seed to the flank of the 
rock, which was as perpen- 
dicular as an iron curtain ; 
and the tree was born there, 
two hundred yards above 
the torrent, inaccessible and 
solitary, among the burning 
and barren stones. From 
the first hour, it had sent 
its blind roots on a long 
and painful search for pre- 
carious water and soil. But 
this was only the hereditary 
care of a species that knows 
the aridity of the South. 
The young stem had to 
solve a much graver and 
more unexpected problem : 
it started from a vertical 
plane, so that its top, 
instead of rising towards 



••£-28-> 



the sky, bent down over 
the gulf. It was obliged, 
therefore, notwithstanding 
the increasing weight of 
its branches, to correct the 
first flight, stubbornly to 
bend its disconcerted trunk 
in the form of an elbow 
close to the rock and thus, 
like a swimmer who throws 
back his head, by means 
of an incessant will, ten- 
sion and contraction to hold 
its heavy crown of leaves 
straight up into the sky. 

Thenceforward, all the 
preoccupations, all the en- 
ergy, all the free and con- 
scious genius of the plant 
had centred around that vital 
knot. The monstrous, hy- 
pertrophied elbow revealed, 



-"S-29"" 3 *" 



one by one, the successive 
solicitudes of a kind of 
thought that knew how to 
profit by the warnings 
which it received from the 
rains and the storms. Year 
by year, the leafy dome 
grew heavier, with no other 
care than to spread itself 
out in the light and heat, 
while a hidden canker 
gnawed deep into the tragic 
arm that supported it in 
space. Then, obeying I 
know not what order of 
the instinct, two stout roots, 
two fibrous cables, issuing 
from the trunk at more 
than two feet above the 
elbow, had come to moor 
it to the granite wall. Had 
they really been evoked by 



-§-3o-§» 



the tree's distress, or were 
they perhaps waiting provi- 
dently, from the first day, 
for the acute hour of dan- 
ger, in order to increase the 
value of their assistance? 
Was it only a happy acci- 
dent? What human eye 
will ever assist at these 
silent dramas, which are 
all too long for our short 
lives ? 1 

VI 

Among the vegetals that 
give the most striking proofs 

1 Let us compare with this the act of intelli- 
gence of another root, whose exploits are related 
by Brandis in his Veber Leben und Polaritat. 
In penetrating into the earth, it had come upon 
an old boot-sole : in order to cross this obstacle, 
which, apparently, the root was the first of its 
kind to find upon its road, it subdivided itself 
into as many parts as there were holes left in 
the sole by the stitching-needle ; then, when the 
obstacle was overcome, it came together again 
and united all its divided radicles in such a way 
as to form a single homogeneous tap-root. 



-e-3i-> 



of initiative, the plants 
which might be described 
as ' ' animated " or " sen- 
tient" deserve to be studied 
in detail. I will do no 
more than recall the de- 
lightful nervous terrors of 
the Sensitive-plant, the 
'shrinking Mimosa which 
we all know. There are 
other herbs endowed with 
spontaneous movements 
that are not so well known, 
notably the Hedysarese, 
among which the Hedysa- 
rum gyrans, or Moving-plant, 
acts in a very restless and 
surprising fashion. This 
little Leguminosa, which is a 
native of Bengal, but often 
cultivated in our hothouses, 
performs a sort of perpetual 



-1-32-i- 



and intricate dance in hon- 
our of the light. Its leaves 
are divided into three foli- 
oles, one wide and terminal, 
the two others narrow and 
planted at the base of the 
first. Each of these leaflets 
is animated with a different 
movement of its own. They 
live in a state of rhythmical, 
almost chronometrical and 
continuous agitation. They 
are so sensitive to light that 
their dance flags or quickens 
according as the clouds veil 
or uncover that corner of 
the sky which they con- 
template. They are, as we 
see, real photometers ; and 
this long before Crook's 
discovery of the natural 
otheoscopes.

• But these plants, to 
which should be added the 
Droseras, the Dionaeas and 
many others, are nervous 
plants that already go a 
little beyond the mysterious 
and probably imaginary 
ridge that separates the 
vegetable from the animal 
kingdom. It is not neces- 
sary to seek so high; and 
we find as much intelli- 
gence and almost as much 
visible spontaneity at the 
other end of the world 
which we are considering, 
in the shallows where the 
plant is hardly to be distin- 
guished from clay or stone : 
I refer to the fabulous class 



-§-34-§- 



of the Cryptogamia, which 
can be studied only under 
the microscope. For this 
reason we will pass it by 
in silence, although the 
work of the sporules of the 
Mushroom, the Fern and 
especially of the Scouring- 
rush or Horse-tail is incom- 
parable in its delicacy and 
ingenuity. But, among the 
aquatic plants, the inhabi- 
tants of the original ooze 
and mud, we can see less 
secret marvels performed. 
As the fertilization of their 
flowers cannot be accom- 
plished under water, each 
of them has thought out a 
different system to allow of 
the dry dissemination of the 
pollen. Thus, the Zosteras, 



-^35-*- 



that is to say, the common 
Sea wrack with which we 
stuff our beds, carefully en- 
close their flower in a 
regular diving-bell ; and the 
Water-lilies send theirs to 
blossom on the surface of 
the pond, supporting and 
feeding it at the top of an 
endless stalk, which length- 
ens as the level of the water 
rises. The Fringed Vil- 
larsia (Villarsia nymphoides), 
having no expanding stalk, 
simply lets its flowers go : 
they rise to the surface 
and burst like bubbles . The 
Trapa natans, or Water- 
caltrop, supplies them with 
a sort of inflated tumour: 
they shoot up and open ; 
then, when the fertilization 



-*-36 -*■ 



is accomplished, the air in 
the tumour is replaced by 
a mucilaginous fluid, which 
is heavier than the water, 
and the whole apparatus 
sinks back again to the slime, 
where the fruits ripen. 

The system of the 
Utricularia is even more 
complicated. M. Henri 
Bocquillon describes it in 
his Vie des Plantes: 

' ' These plants, which are 
common in ponds, ditches, 
pools and the puddles of 
peat-bogs, are not visible 
in winter, when they lie on 
the mud. Their long, slim, 
trailing stalk is furnished 
with leaves reduced to 
ramified filaments. At the 



-s-37-s- 



axilla of the leaves thus 
transformed, we see a sort 
of little pyriform pocket 
with an aperture in its 
pointed upper end. This 
aperture has a valve, which 
can be opened only from 
the outside inwards; its 
edges are provided with 
ramified hairs ; the inside 
of the pocket is covered 
with other little secretory 
hairs which give it the 
appearance of velvet. 
When the moment of 
efflorescence comes, the 
axillary Utricles fill with 
air : the more this air tends 
to escape, the more tightly 
it closes the valve. The 
result is that it imparts a 
great specific buoyancy to 



-«-38-§- 



the plant and carries it to 
the surface of the water. 
Not till then do those charm- 
ing little yellow flowers 
come into blossom, resem- 
bling quaint little mouths 
with more or less swollen 
lips and palates streaked 
with orange or rubiginous 
lines. During the months 
of June, July and August, 
they display their, fresh 
colours gracefully above 
the muddy water, amid 
the vegetable decay around 
them. But fertilization has 
been effected, the fruit de- 
velops, all things play a 
different part : the ambient 
water presses upon the valve 
of the utricles, forces it in, 
rushes into the cavity, 



^-3g->- 



weighs down the plant and 
compels it to descend to the 
mud again." 

Is it not interesting to 
see thus gathered in this 
immemorial little apparatus 
some of the most fruitful 
and recent of human in- 
ventions : the play of valves 
or plugs, the pressure of 
fluids and air, the Archi- 
medean principle studied 
and turned to account? As 
the author whom we have 
just quoted observes, "The 
engineer who first attached 
a rafting apparatus to a sunk 
ship little thought that a 
similar process had been 
in use for thousands of 
years." In a world which 



->S-4o-3«- 



we believe unconscious and 
destitute of intelligence, we 
begin by imagining that the 
least of our ideas creates 
new combinations and re- 
lations. When we come 
to look into things more 
closely, it appears infinitely 
probable that it is impossible 
for us to create anything 
whatsoever. We are the 
last comers on this earth, 
we simply find what has 
always existed and, like 
astonished children, we 
travel again the road which 
life had travelled before 
us. When all is said, it 
is very natural and com- 
forting that this should be 
so. But we will return 
to this point. 



-s-4i-> 



VIII 

We cannot take leave of 
the aquatic plants without 
briefly mentioning the life 
of the most romantic of 
them all : the legendary Val- 
lisneria, an Hydrocharad 
whose nuptials form the 
most tragic episode in the 
love-history of the flowers. 
\ The Vallisneria is a rather 
insignificant herb, possess- 
ing none of the strange 
grace of the Water-lily or 
of certain submersed comas . 
But it seems as though 
nature had delighted in 
giving it a beautiful idea. 
The whole existence of the 
little plant is spent at the 
bottom of the water, in a 



-£-42-> 



sort of half-slumber, until 
the moment of the wedding- 
hour in which it aspires to 
a new life. Then the female 
flower slowly uncoils the 
long spiral of its peduncle, 
rises, emerges and floats 
and blossoms on the sur- 
face of the pond. From 
a neighbouring stem, the 
male flowers, which see it 
through the sunlit water, 
soar in their turn, full of 
hope, towards the one that 
rocks, that awaits them, 
that calls them to a magic 
world. But, when they 
have come half-way, they 
feel themselves suddenly 
held back: their stalk, the 
very source of their life, 
is too short ; they will never 



-«-43-> 



reach the abode of light, the 
only spot in which the union 
of the stamens and the pistil 
can be achieved ! . . . 

Is there any more cruel 
inadvertence or ordeal in na- 
ture? Picture the tragedy 
of that longing, the inac- 
cessible so nearly attained, 
the transparent fatality, the 
impossible with not a visible 
obstacle ! ... It would be 
insoluble, like our own 
tragedy upon this earth, 
were it not that an unex- 
pected element is mingled 
with it. Did the males 
foresee the disillusion to 
which they would be sub- 
jected? One thing is certain, 
that they have locked up 
in their hearts a bubble of 



<~kk-> 



air, even as we lock up in 
our souls a thought of 
desperate deliverance. It 
is as though they hesitated 
for a moment; then, with 
a magnificent effort, the 
finest, the most supernatural 
that I know of in the annals 
of the insects and the flowers , 
in order to rise to happiness 
they deliberately break the 
bond that attaches them to 
life. They tear themselves 
from their peduncle and, 
with an incomparable flight, 
amid pearly beads of glad- 
ness, their petals dart up 
and break the surface of 
the water. Wounded to 
death, but radiant and free, 
they float for a moment 
beside their heedless brides 



-f-45-3- 



and the union is accom- 
plished, whereupon the 
victims drift away to perish, 
while the wife, already a 
mother, closes her corolla, 
in which lives their last 
breath, rolls up her spiral 
and descends to the depths, 
there to ripen the fruit of 
the heroic kiss. 

Must we spoil this charm- 
ing picture, which is strictly 
accurate, but seen from the 
side of the light, by looking 
at it also from that of the 
shadow? Why not? There 
are sometimes on the shady 
side truths quite as interest- 
ing as those on the bright. 
This delightful tragedy is 
perfect only when we con- 
sider the intelligence, the 



<-46-> 



aspirations of the species. 
But, if we observe indi- 
viduals, we shall often see 
them act awkwardly and in 
the wrong way in this ideal 
plan. At one time, the 
male flowers will ascend 
to the surface when there 
are not yet any pistilled 
flowers near. At another, 
when the low water would 
permit them easily to join 
their companions, they will 
nevertheless mechanically 
and to no purpose break 
their stalks. We here once 
more establish the fact that 
all genius lies in the species, 
in life or nature ; and that 
the individual is nearly al- 
ways stupid. In man alone 
does a real emulation exist 



-s-47~> 



between the two intelli- 
gences, a more and more 
precise, more and more 
active tendency towards a 
sort of equilibrium which 
is the great secret of our 
future. 

IX 

The parasitic plants also 
present curious and crafty 
spectacles, as in the case 
of the astonishing Cuscuta, 
commonly called the Dod- 
der. It has no leaves ; and 
no sooner has its stalk 
attained a few inches in 
length than it voluntarily 
abandons its roots to twine 
about its chosen victim, 
into which it digs its suck- 
ers. Thenceforth, it lives 



-§-48-i» 



exclusively upon its prey. 
Its perspicacity is not to 
be deceived; it will refuse 
any support that does not 
please it and will go some 
distance, if necessary, in 
search of the stem of Hemp, 
Hop, Lucern or Flax that 
suits its temperament and 
its taste. 

This Cuscuta naturally 
calls our attention to the 
Creepers, which have very 
remarkable habits and 
which deserve a word to 
themselves. Those of us 
who have lived a little in 
the country have often had 
occasion to admire the in- 
stinct, the sort of power 
of vision that directs the 
tendrils of the Virginian 



■ -s-49~> 



Creeper or the Convol- 
vulus towards the handle 
of a rake or spade resting 
against a wall. Move the 
rake and, the next day, 
the tendril will have turned 
completely round and found 
it again. Schopenhauer, 
in his treatise Ueber den 
Willen in der Natur, in the 
chapter devoted to the 
physiology of plants, re- 
capitulates on this point 
and on many others a host 
of observations and experi- 
ments which it would take 
too long to set out here. 
I therefore refer the reader 
to this chapter, where he will 
find numerous sources and 
references noted down for 
him. Need I add that, in 



-£~bo~3+ 



the past fifty or sixty years, 
these sources have been 
strangely multiplied and 
that, besides, the subject 
is almost inexhaustible? 

Among so many different 
inventions, artifices and pre- 
cautions, let us mention also, 
for instance, the foresight 
displayed by the Hyoseris 
radiata, or Starry Swine's- 
succory, a little yellow- 
flowered plant, not unlike 
the Dandelion and often 
found on the old walls along 
the Riviera. In order to 
ensure both the dissemi- 
nation and the stability of 
its race, it bears at one and 
the same time two kinds of 
seeds: the first are easily 
detached and are furnished 



^-5 1 -s* 



with wings wherewith to 
abandon themselves to the 
wind, while the others have 
no wings, remain captive 
in the inflorescence and 
are set free only when the 
latter is decomposed. 

The case of the Xanthium 
spinosum,or Spiny Xanthium, 
shows us how well conceived 
and effective certain systems 
of dissemination can be. 
This Xanthium is a hideous 
weed, bristling with bar- 
baric prickles. Not long 
ago, it was unknown in 
Western Europe and no 
one, naturally, had dreamt 
of acclimatizing it. It owes 
its conquests to the hooks 
which finish off the capsules 
of its fruits and which cling 



-s-5a-> 



to the fleece of the animals. 
A native of Russia, it came 
to us in bales of wool im- 
ported from the depths of 
the Muscovite steppes ; and 
one might follow on the 
map the stages of this great 
emigrant which has annexed 
a new world. 

The Silene Italica, or Italian 
Catchfly, a simple little white 
flower, found in abundance 
under the olive-trees, has 
set its thought working in 
another direction. Ap- 
parently very timorous, 
very susceptible, to avoid 
the visits of importunate 
and indelicate insects it 
furnishes its stalks with 
glandular bristles, whence 
oozes a viscid fluid in which 



-*-53-5* 



the parasites are caught 
with such success that the 
peasants of the South use 
the plant as a fly-catcher in 
their houses. Certain kinds 
of Gatchflies, moreover, 
have ingeniously simplified 
the system. Dreading the 
ants in particular, they dis- 
covered that it was enough, 
in order to prevent them 
from passing, to place a 
wide viscid ring under the 
node of each stalk. This is 
exactly what our gardeners 
do when they draw a circle 
of tar around the trunk of 
the apple-trees to stop the 
ascent of the caterpillars. 

This leads to the study 
of the defensive means 
employed by the plants. 



<~hk~y- 



In an excellent popular 
work, Les Plantes originales, 
to which I refer the reader 
who wishes for fuller details, 
M. Henri Coupin examines 
some of these quaint and 
startling weapons. We 
have first the stimulating 
question of the thorns, con- 
cerning which M. Lothelier, 
a student at the Sorbonne, 
has made a number of 
interesting experiments, 
resulting in the conclusion 
that shade and damp tend 
to suppress the prickly 
parts of the plants. On 
the other hand, whenever 
the place in which it grows 
is dry and burnt by the 
sun, the plant bristles and 
multiplies its spikes, as 



->^55-> 



though it understood that, 
as almost the sole survivor 
among the deserted rocks 
or in the hot sand, it is 
called upon to make a 
mighty effort to redouble 
its defences against an 
enemy that no longer has 
a choice of victims to prey 
upon. It is a remarkable 
fact, moreover, that, when 
cultivated by man, most of 
the thorny plants gradually 
lay aside their weapons, 
leaving the care of their 
safety to the supernatural 
protector who has adopted 
them in his fenced grounds. 1 

1 Among the plants that have ceased to defend 
themselves, the most striking case is that of the 
Lettuce : 

"In its wild state," says the author whom I 
have mentioned above, "if we break a stalk or 
a leaf, we see a white juice exude from it, the 



-s-56-3- 



Certain plants, among 
others the Boragineae, supply 
the place of thorns with very 
hard bristles. Others, such 
as the Nettle, add poison. 
Others, the Geranium, the 
Mint, the Rue, steep them- 
selves in powerful odours 
to keep off the animals. 
But the strangest are those 
which defend themselves 

latex, a substance formed of different matters 
which vigorously defend the plant against the 
attacks of the slugs. On the other hand, in 
the cultivated species derived from the former, 
the latex is almost missing, for which reason the 
plant, to the despair of the gardeners, is no longer 
able to resist and allows the slugs to eat it." 

It is nevertheless right to add that this latex 
is rarely lacking except in the young plants, 
whereas it becomes quite abundant when the 
Lettuce begins to " cabbage " and when it runs 
to seed. Now it is especially at the commence- 
ment of its life, at the budding of its first, tender 
leaves, that the plant is in need of self-defence. 
One is inclined to think that the cultivated 
Lettuce loses its head a little, if I may so express 
myself, and that it no longer knows exactly 
where it stands. 



••S-57-+- 



mechanically. I will men- 
tion only the Horsetail, 
which surrounds itself with 
a veritable armour of mi- 
croscopic silicas. Moreover, 
almost all the Graminese, 
in order to discourage the 
gluttony of the slugs and 
snails, add lime to their 
tissues. 

X 

Before broaching the 
study of the complicated 
forms of apparatus ren- 
dered necessary by cross- 
fertilization, among the 
thousands of nuptial cere- 
monies that prevail in our 
gardens, let us mention the 
ingenious ideas of some very 
simple flowers, in which 



-§-58 -> 



the grooms and brides are 
born, love and die in the 
same corolla. The typical 
system is well enough 
known: the stamens, or 
male organs, generally 
frail and numerous, stand 
grouped around the robust 
and patient pistil : "Mariti et 
uxores uno eodemque thalamo 
gaudent," says the great 
Linnaeus, delightfully. But 
the disposition, the form, 
the habits of these organs 
vary in every flower, as 
though nature had a thought 
that cannot yet become 
settled, or an imagination 
that makes it a point of 
honour never to repeat itself. 
Often, the pollen, when ripe, 
falls quite naturally from 



-§-5c)-> 



the top of the stamens upon 
the pistil; but, very often, 
also, pistil and stamens are 
of the same height, or the 
latter are too far away, or 
the pistil is twice as tall 
as they are. Then come 
endless efforts to succeed in 
meeting. Sometimes, as in 
the Nettle, the stamens, at 
the bottom of the corolla, 
stand cowering on their 
stalk: at the moment of 
fertilization, the stalk 
straightens out like a spring 
and the anther or pollen- 
mass that tops it shoots 
a cloud of dust over the 
stigma. Sometimes, as in 
the Barberry, whose nup- 
tials can be accomplished 
only in the bright hours of 



-*-6o-s- 



a cloudless day, the stamens, 
far removed from the pistil, 
.are kept against the sides 
of the flower by the weight 
of two moist glands : the 
sun appears and evaporates 
the fluid and the unballasted 
stamens are flung upon the 
stigma. Elsewhere are dif- 
ferent things again : thus, 
in the Primroses, the females 
are by turns longer and 
shorter than the males. In 
the Lily, the Tulip and 
other flowers, the too lanky 
bride does what she can 
to gather and fix the pollen. 
But the most original and 
fantastic system is that of 
the Rue (Ruta graveolens), a 
somewhat evil-smelling me- 
dicinal herb of the ill-famed 



-*-6i-> 



emmenagogic tribe. The 
peaceful and docile stamens, 
drawn up in a circle around 
the fat, squat pistil, wait 
expectant in the yellow 
corolla. At the conjugal 
hour, obeying the com- 
mand of the female, which 
apparently gives a sort of call 
by name, one of the males 
approaches and touches the 
stigma. Then come the 
third, the fifth, the seventh, 
the ninth male, until the 
whole row of odd numbers 
has rendered service. Next, 
in the even ranks, comes 
the turn of the second, the 
fourth, the sixth and so on. 
Here is love to order indeed ! 
This flower which knows 
how to count appeared to 

4 



-*-6a->- 



me so extraordinary that I 
at first refused to believe 
the botanists; and I was 
determined to test its sense 
of numbers more than 
once before accepting it. 
I have ascertained that it 
but seldom makes a 
mistake. 

It is needless to multiply 
these instances. A stroll 
in the woods or fields will 
allow any one to make a 
thousand observations in 
this direction, each quite 
as curious as those related 
by the botanists. But, 
before closing this chapter, 
I would mention one more 
flower : not that it displays 
any extraordinary imagina- 
tion, but because of the 



«£-63-> 



delightful and easily per- 
ceptible grace of its move- 
ment of love. I allude 
to the Nigella Damascena, or 
Fennel-flower, whose folk- 
names are charming: 
Love-in-a-mist, Devil-in-a- 
bush, Ragged-lady; so 
many happy and touching 
efforts of popular poetry 
to describe a little flower 
that pleases it. This plant 
is found in a wild state in 
the South, by the roadside 
and under the olive-trees, 
and is often cultivated in 
the North in old-fashioned 
gardens. Its blossom is 
pale-blue, simple as a 
floweret in a primitive 
painting, and the "Venus' 
locks" or "ragged locks" 



-*-64-> 



that give the Ragged-lady 
its popular name in France 
are the light, tenuous, 
tangled leaves that sur- 
round the corolla with a 
"bush" of misty verdure. 
At the source of the flower, 
the five extremely long 
pistils stand close-grouped 
in the centre of the azure 
crown, like five queens clad 
in green gowns, haughty 
and inaccessible. Around 
them crowd hopelessly the 
innumerous throng of their 
lovers, the stamens, which 
do not come up to their 
knees. And now, in the 
heart of this palace of 
sapphires and turquoises, 
in the gladness of the 
summer days, begins the 



-g-65-> 



drama without words or 
catastrophe which one 
might expect, the drama of 
powerless, useless, motion- 
less waiting. But the hours 
pass that are the flower's 
years : its brilliancy fades, 
its petals fall and the pride 
of the great queens seems 
at last to bend under the 
weight of life. At a given 
moment, as though obeying 
the secret and irresistible 
command of love, which 
deems the proof to have 
lasted long enough, with a 
concerted and symmetrical 
movement, comparable with 
the harmonious parabolas 
of a five-fold fountain falling 
into its basin, they all to- 
gether bend backwards and 



<-66-> 



gracefully cull the golden 
dust of the nup tial kiss on the 
lips of their humble lovers. 

XI 

The unexpected abounds 
here, as we see. A great 
volume, therefore, might be 
written on the intelligence of 
the plants, even as Romanes 
wrote one on animal in- 
telligence. But this sketch 
has no pretension to become 
a manual of that kind ; and 
I wish only to call attention 
to a few interesting events 
that happen beside us in 
this world wherein we think 
ourselves, a little too vain- 
gloriously, privileged. 
These events are not 
selected, but taken, by way 



-£-67-3- 



of instances, as the random 
result of observation and 
circumstances. I propose, 
however, in these short 
notes, to concern myself 
before all with the flower, 
for it is in the flower that 
the greatest marvels shine 
forth. I set aside, for the 
moment, the carnivorous 
flowers, Droseras, Ne- 
penthes, Sarracenias, and 
the rest, which approach 
the animal kingdom and 
would demand a special 
and expansive study, in 
order to devote myself to 
the true flower, the flower 
proper, which we believe to 
be insentient and inanimate. 
To separate facts from 
theories, let us speak of 



-§-68-> 



the flower as though all 
that it has realized had been 
foreseen and conceived in 
the manner of men. We 
shall see later how much 
we must leave to it, how 
much take away from it. 
For the present, let it take 
the stage alone, like a 
splendid princess endowed 
with reason and will . There 
is no denying that it appears 
provided with both ; and to 
deprive it of either we must 
resort to very obscure hy- 
potheses. It is there, then, 
motionless on its stalk, 
sheltering in a dazzling 
tabernacle the reproduc- 
tive organs of the plant. 
Seemingly, it has but to 
allow the mysterious union 



-s-6()-> 



of the stamens and pistil 
to be accomplished in this 
tabernacle of love. And 
many flowers do so con- 
sent. But to many others 
there is propounded, big 
with awful threats, the 
normally insoluble prob- 
lem of cross-fertilization. 
As the result of what num- 
berless and immemorial 
experiments did they ob- 
serve that self-fertilization 
— that is the fertilization 
of the stigma by the pollen 
falling from the anthers 
that surround it in the 
same corolla — rapidly in- 
duces the degeneration of 
the species? They have 
observed nothing, we are 
told, nor profited by any 



-*-7°" > 



experience. The force of 
things quite simply and 
gradually eliminated the 
seeds and plants weakened 
by self-fertilization. Soon, 
only those survived which, 
through some anomaly, 
such as the exaggerated 
length of the pistil, render- 
ing it inaccessible to the 
anthers, were prevented 
from fertilizing themselves. 
These exceptions alone en- 
dured, through a thousand 
revolutions; heredity finally 
determined the work of 
chance; and the normal 
type disappeared. 

XII 

We shall see presently 
what light these explanations 



-*- 7 1 '^*" 



throw. For the moment, 
let us go once more into 
the garden or the field, 
to study more closely two 
or three curious inventions 
of the genius of the flower. 
And, already, without go- 
ing far from the house, we 
have here, frequented by 
the bees, a sweet-scented 
cluster inhabited by a most 
skilled mechanic. There is 
no one, even among the 
least countrified, but knows 
the good Sage. It is an 
unpretending Labiata and 
bears a very modest flower, 
which opens violently, like 
a hungry mouth, to snap 
the rays of the sun in 
passing. For that matter, 
it presents a large number 



-s-7 2 ^ 



of varieties, not all of which 
— this is a curious detail — 
have adopted or carried to 
the same pitch of perfection 
the system of fertilization 
which we are about to ex- 
amine. But I am concerned 
here only with the most 
common Sage, that which, 
at this moment, as though 
to celebrate spring's passage, 
covers with violet draperies 
all the walls of my terraces 
of olive-trees. I assure you 
that the balconies of the 
great marble palaces that 
await the kings were never 
more luxuriously, more 
happily, more fragrantly 
adorned. One seems to 
catch the very perfumes 
of the light of the sun at 



-^-7^" > 



its hottest, when noon-day 
strikes. . . . 

To come to details, the 
stigma or female organ of 
the flower is contained in 
the upper lip, which forms 
a sort of hood, in which 
are also the two stamens 
or v male organs. To pre- 
vent these from fertilizing 
the stigma which shares 
the same nuptial tent, this 
stigma is twice as long as 
they, so that they have no 
hope of reaching it. More- 
over, to avoid all accidents, 
the flower has made itself 
protenandrous, that is to 
say, the stamens ripen be- 
fore the pistil, so that, 
when the female is fit to 
conceive, the males have 



•*-7^**" 



already disappeared. It is 
necessary, therefore, that 
an external force should 
intervene to accomplish the 
union by carrying a foreign 
pollen to the abandoned 
stigma. A certain number 
of flowers, the anemophi- 
lous flowers, leave this 
care to the wind. But the 
Sage — and this is the more 
general case — is entomophi- 
lous, that is to say, it loves 
insects and relies upon their 
collaboration alone. Still, 
it is quite aware, for it 
knows many things, that 
it lives in a world where 
it is best to expect no sym- 
pathy, no charitable aid. 
It does not waste time, 
therefore, in making useless 



-s-75-3- 



appeals to the courtesy of 
the bee. The bee, like 
all that struggles against 
death in this world of ours, 
exists only for herself and 
for her kind and is in no 
way concerned to render a 
service to the flowers that 
feed her. How shall she be 
obliged, in spite of herself, 
or at least unconsciously, to 
fulfil her matrimonial office? 
Observe the wonderful love- 
trap contrived by the Sage : 
right at the back of its tent 
of violet silk, it distils a 
few drops of nectar; this 
is the bait. But, barring 
the access to the sugary 
fluid, stand two parallel 
stalks, somewhat similar 
to the uprights of a Dutch 



<^']6~^- 



drawbridge. Right at the 
top of each stalk is a great 
sack, the anther, overflow- 
ing with pollen ; at the 
bottom, two smaller sacks 
serve as a counterpoise. 
When the bee enters the 
flower, in order to reach 
the nectar she has to push 
the small sacks with her 
head. The two stalks, which 
turn on an axis, at once 
topple over and the upper 
anthers come down and 
touch the sides of the 
insect, whom they cover 
with fertilizing dust. No 
sooner has the bee departed 
than the springy pivots 
fly back and replace the 
mechanism in its first 
position; and all is ready 



-fr-77' 



to repeat the work at the 
next visit. 

However, this is only the 
first half of the play: the 
sequel is enacted in another 
scene. In a neighbouring 
flower, whose stamens 
have just withered, enters 
upon the stage the pistil 
that awaits the pollen. 
It issues slowly from the 
hood, lengthens out, 
stoops, curves down, be- 
comes forked so as, in its 
turn, to bar the entrance 
to the tent. On its way 
to the nectar, the head of 
the bee passes freely under 
the hanging fork, which, 
however, grazes her back 
and sides exactly at the 
spots touched by the 



-£-78-2*" 



stamens. The two-cleft 
stigma greedily absorbs the 
silvery dust; and the im- 
pregnation is accomplished. 
It is easy, for that matter, 
by introducing a straw or 
the end of a match, to set 
the apparatus going and to 
take stock of the striking 
and marvellous combina- 
tion and precision of all 
its movements. 

The varieties of the 
Sage are very many — they 
number about five hundred 
— and I will spare you the 
majority of their scientific 
names, which are not al- 
ways pretty : Salvia pratensis, 
officinalis (our Garden Sage), 
Horminum, Horminoides, gluti- 
nosa, Sclarea, Roemeri, azurea, 



-§-79~ s " 



Pitcheri, splendens (the mag- 
nificent Sage of our baskets) 
and so on. There is not, per- 
haps, one but has modified 
some detail of the machinery 
which we have just ex- 
amined. Some — and this, 
I think, is a doubtful im- 
provement — have doubled 
and sometimes trebled the 
length of the pistil, so that 
it not only emerges from 
the hood, but makes a wide 
plume-like curve in front 
of the entrance to the 
flower. They thus avoid 
the just-possible danger of 
the fertilization of the 
stigma by the anthers 
dwelling in the same hood; 
but, on the other hand, 
it may happen, if the 



-s-8o-> 



protenandry be not strict, 
that the insect, on leaving 
the flower, deposits on the 
stigma the pollen of the 
very anthers with which 
the stigma cohabits. 
Others, in the movement 
of the lever, make the 
anthers diverge farther 
apart so as to strike the 
sides of the animal with 
greater precision. Others, 
lastly, have not succeeded 
in arranging and adjusting 
every part of the mechanism . 
I find, for instance, not far 
from my violet Sages, near 
the well, under a cluster 
of Oleanders, a family of 
white flowers tinted with 
pale lilac. These have no 
suggestion or trace of a 



-*-8i-s~ 



lever. The stamens and 
the stigma are heaped up 
promiscuously in the mid- 
dle of the corolla. All 
seems left to chance and 
disorganized. 

I have no doubt that it 
would be possible, to any 
one collecting the very 
numerous varieties of this 
Labiata, to reconstruct the 
whole history, to follow all 
the stages of the invention, 
from the primitive disorder 
of the white Sage under my 
eyes to the latest improve- 
ments of the Salvia pratensis . 
What conclusion are we to 
draw? Is the system still 
in the experimental stage 
among the aromatic tribe? 
Has it not yet left the period 



-s- 82 



of models and ' ' trial trips," 
as in the case of the Archi- 
medean screw in the Saint- 
foin family? Has the 
excellence of the automatic 
lever not yet been unani- 
mously admitted? Can it 
be, then, that everything 
is not unchangeable and 
pre-established; and are 
they still discussing and ex- 
perimenting in this world 
which we believe to be fatally, 
organically regular? x 

XIII 

Be this as it may, the 
flower of most varieties 

1 For some years, I have been engaged upon 
a series of experiments in the hybridization of 
Sages, artificially fertilizing (first taking the 
usual precautions against any interference of 
wind or insects) a variety of which the floral 
mechanism has reached a high state of perfection 



*§-83-s- 



of the Sage presents an 
attractive solution of the 
great problem of cross- 
fertilization. But, even as, 
among men, a new inven- 
tion is at once taken up, 
simplified, improved by a 
host of small indefatigable 
seekers, so, in the world 
of what we may call 
mechanical flowers, the 



with the pollen of a very backward variety ; 
and vice versa. My observations are not yet 
sufficiently numerous to permit me to give any 
details here. Nevertheless, it appears that a 
general law is already being evolved, namely 
that the backward Sage readily adopts the 
improvements of the more advanced variety, 
whereas the latter is not so prone to accept the 
defects of the first. This would tend to throw 
an interesting side-light upon the operations, 
the habits, the preferences, the tastes of nature 
at her best. But these experiments are neces- 
sarily slow and long in the making, because of 
the time lost in collecting the different varieties, 
of the numberless proofs and counter-proofs 
required and so on. It would be .premature, 
therefore, as yet to draw the slightest conclusion 
from them.

patent of the Sage has 
been elaborated and in 
many details strangely 
perfected. A pretty general 
Scrophularinea, the common 
Lousewort, or Red-rattle 
(Pedicularis sylvatica) which 
you must surely have 
noticed in the shady parts 
of small woods and heaths, 
has introduced some ex- 
tremely ingenious modifi- 
cations. The shape of the 
corolla is almost similar 
to that of the Sage ; the 
stigma and the two anthers 
are all three contained in 
the upper hood. Only the 
little moist tip of the pistil 
protrudes from the hood, 
while the anthers remain 
strictly captive. In this 



• 85-> 



silky tabernacle, therefore, 
the organs of the two sexes 
are very close together and 
even in immediate contact; 
nevertheless, thanks to an 
arrangement quite different 
from that of the Sage, self- 
fertilization is made abso- 
lutely impossible. The 
anthers, in fact, form two 
sacks filled with powder; 
each of these sacks has 
only one opening and they 
are juxtaposed in such a 
way that these openings 
coincide and mutually 
close- each other. They 
are forcibly kept inside 
the hood, on their curved, 
springy stalks, by a sort of 
teeth. The bee or humble- 
bee that enters the flower 



*§-86-s- 



to sip its nectar necessarily 
pushes these teeth aside; 
and the sacks are no sooner 
set free than they fly up, 
. are flung outside and 
alight upon the back of 
the insect. 

But the genius and fore- 
sight of the flower go far- 
ther than this. As Hermann 
Miiller, who was the first 
to make a complete study 
of the wonderful mechan- 
ism of the Lousewort, 
observes (I am quoting 
from a summary) : 

"If the stamens struck 
the insect while preserving 
their relative positions, not 
a grain of pollen would 
leave them, because their 



0S-87 •> 



orifices reciprocally close 
each other. But a con- 
trivance which is as simple 
as it is ingenious overcomes 
the difficulty. The lower 
lip of the corolla, instead 
of being symmetrical and 
horizontal, is irregular and 
slanting, so that one side 
of it is higher by a few 
millimetres than the other. 
The humble-bee resting 
upon it must herself neces- 
sarily stand in a sloping 
position. The result is 
that her head strikes first 
one and then the other 
of the projections of the 
corolla. Therefore the re- 
leasing of the stamens also 
takes place successively; 
and, when their orifices 



-+-88-+. 



are freed, they strike the 
insect, one after the other, 
and sprinkle her with the 
fertilizing dust. 

"When the humble-bee 
next passes to another 
flower, she inevitably fer- 
tilizes it, because — and I 
have purposely omitted this 
detail — what she meets first 
of all, when thrusting her 
head into the entrance to 
the corolla, is the stigma, 
which grazes her just at 
the spot where she is 
about, the moment after, 
to b? struck by the sta- 
mens, the exact spot 
where she has already been 
touched by the stamens of 
the flower which she has 
last left."

These instances might 
be multiplied indefinitely; 
every flower has its idea, 
its system, its acquired 
experience which it turns 
to advantage. When we 
examine closely their little 
inventions, their diverse 
methods, we are reminded 
of those captivating ex- 
hibitions of machine-tools, 
of machines for making 
machinery, in which the 
mechanical genius of ; man 
reveals all its resources. 
But our mechanical genius 
dates from yesterday, 
whereas floral mechanism 
has been at work for thou- 
sands of years. When the 



<-yo~&- 



flowers made their appear- 
ance upon our earth, there 
were no models around them 
which they could imitate; 
|hey had to derive every- 
thing from within them- 
selves. At the period when 
we had not gone beyond 
the club, the bow and the 
flail; in the comparatively 
recent days when we con- 
ceived the spinning-wheel, 
the pulley, the tackle, the 
ram; at the time — it was 
last year, so to speak — 
when our master-pieces 
were the catapult, the clock 
and the weaving-loom, the 
Sage had contrived the up- 
rights and counterweights 
of its lever of precision 
and the Lousewort its sacks 



-e-9 1 -** 



closed up as though for a 
scientific experiment, the 
successive releasing of its 
springs and the combina- 
tion of its inclined planes^ 
Who, say a hundred years 
ago, dreamt of the proper- 
ties of the screw which the 
Maple and the Lime-tree 
have been turning to use 
since the birth of the trees? 
When shall we succeed in 
building a parachute or a 
flying-machine as rigid, as 
light, as subtle and as safe 
as that of the Dandelion? 
When shall we discover the 
secret of cutting in so frail 
a fabric as the silk of the 
petals a spring as powerful 
as that which projects into 
space the golden pollen of 



+Z-Q2-3+ 



the Spanish Broom? As 
for the Momordica, or 
Squirting Cucumber, whose 
name I mentioned at the be- 
ginning of this little study, 
who shall tell us the mystery 
of its miraculous strength? 
Do you know the Momor- 
dica? It is a humble Cu- 
curbitacea, common enough 
along the Mediterranean 
coast. Its prickly fruit, 
which resembles a small 
cucumber, is endowed with 
inexplicable vitality and en- 
ergy. You have but to 
touch it, at the moment of 
its maturity, and it suddenly 
quits its peduncle by means 
of a convulsive contraction 
and shoots through the hole 
produced by the wrench, 



-*-g3-3+ 



mingled with numerous 
seeds, a mucilaginous 
stream of such wonderful 
intensity that it carries the 
seed to four or five yards' 
distance from the natal 
plant. The action is as 
extraordinary, in propor- 
tion, as though we were 
to succeed in emptying 
ourselves with a single 
spasmpdic movement and in 
precipitating all our organs, 
our viscera and our blood to 
a distance of half a mile from 
our skin and skeleton. 

A large number of seeds 
besides have ballistic 
methods and employ sources 
of energy that are more or 
less unknown to us. Re- 
member, for instance, the 



-^g^"** 



explosions of the Colza and 
the Heath. But one of the 
great masters of vegetable 
artillery is the Spurge. The 
Spurge is an Euphorbiacea 
of our climes, a tall and 
fairly ornamental "weed," 
which often exceeds the 
height of a man. I have 
a branch of Spurge on my 
table at this moment, steep- 
ing in a glass of water. It 
has trifid, greenish berries, 
which contain the seeds. 
From time to time, one of 
these berries bursts with a 
loud report; and the seeds, 
gifted with a prodigious 
initial velocity, strike the 
furniture and the walls on 1 
every side. If one of them 
were to hit you in the face, 



+£-C)5-3- 



you would think that you had 
been stung by an insect, so 
extraordinary is the pene- 
trating force of these tiny 
seeds, each no larger than 
a pin's head. Examine the 
berry, look for the springs 
that give it life: you shall 
not find the secret of this 
force, which is as invisible 
as that of our nerves. 

The Spanish Broom 
(Spartium junceum) has not 
only pods, but flowers fitted 
with springs . You may have 
remarked the admirable 
plant. It is the proudest 
representative of this power- 
ful family of the Brooms. 
Greedy of life, poor, sober, 
robust, dreading no soil, no 
ordeal, it forms along the 



-8-96-*- 



paths and in the mountains 
of the South huge, tufted 
balls, sometimes three yards 
high, which, between May 
and June, are covered with 
a magnificent bloom of pure 
gold, whose perfumes, ming- 
ling with those of its habitual 
neighbour, the Honeysuckle, 
spread under the fury of a 
scorching sun delights that 
are not to be described 
save by evoking celestial 
dews, Elysian springs, cool 
streams and starry trans- 
parencies in the hollow of 
azure grottoes. . . . 

The flower of this Broom, 
like that of all the papiliona- 
ceous Leguminosse, resembles 
the flowers of the Peas of 
our gardens; and its lower 



-^97^*" 



petals, w elded like the beak 
of a galley, hermetically 
contain the stamens and the 
pistil. So long as it is not 
ripe, the bee who explores 
it finds it impenetrable. 
But, as soon as the moment 
of puberty arrives for the 
captive bride and grooms, 
the beak bends under the 
weight of the insect that 
rests upon it; and the 
golden chamber bursts 
voluptuously, hurling with 
violence and afar, over the 
visitor, over the flowers 
around, a cloud of luminous 
dust, which a broad petal, 
shaped like a penthouse, 
casts down, with a super- 
added precaution, upon the 
stigma to be impregnated.

I refer those who would 
wish to make a thorough 
study of these problems to 
the works of Christian 
Konrad Sprengel, who was 
the first, in 1 793, in his curi- 
ous volume, Das entdeckte 
Geheimniss der Natur im Bau 
und in der Befruchtung der 
Blumen, to analyze the func- 
tions of the different organs 
in the Orchids ; next, to the 
books of Charles Darwin, 
Dr. Hermann Miiller of 
Lippstadt, Hildebrand, 
Delpino the Italian, Sir 
William Hooker, Robert 
Brown and many others. 

We shall find the most per- 
fect andthemostharmonious 



<-99~> 



manifestations of vegetable 
intelligence among the 
Orchids. In these writhing 
and eccentric flowers, the 
genius of the plant touches 
its extreme point and with 
an unusual fire pierces the 
wall that separates the king- 
doms. For that matter, 
this name of Orchid must 
not be allowed to mislead 
us or make us think that we 
have here to do only with 
rare and precious flowers, 
with those hot-house queens 
which seem to claim the care 
of the goldsmith rather than 
the gardener. Our native 
wild flora, which comprises 
all our modest "weeds," 
numbers more than twenty- 
five species of Orchids, 



-S-IOO-3- 



including just the most in- 
genious and complicated. 
It is these which Charles 
Darwin studied in his book, 
On the Various Contrivances 
by which Orchids are fertilized 
by Insects, which is the won- 
derful history of the most 
heroic efforts of the soul of 
the flower. It is out of the 
question that I should here, 
in a few lines, summarize 
that abundant and fairylike 
biography. Nevertheless, 
since we are on the subject 
of the intelligence of flowers, 
it is necessary that I should 
give some idea of the 
methods and the mental 
habits of that which excels 
all the others in the art of 
compelling the bee or the

It is not easy to explain 
without diagrams the 
extraordinarily complex 
mechanism of the Orchid. 
Nevertheless, I will try to 
give a sufficient idea of it 
with the aid of more or less 
approximate comparisons, 
while avoiding as far as 
possible the use of technical 
terms such as retinaculum, 
labellum, rostellum and the rest, 
which evoke no precise im- 
age in the minds of persons 
unfamiliar with botany. 

Let us take one of the 
most widely-distributed 
Orchids in our regions, the 
Orchis maculata, for instance, 
or rather, because it is a 



-*- io3-> 



little larger and therefore 
more easily observed, the 
Orchis latifolia, the Marsh 
Orchid, commonly known 
as the Meadow-rocket. It 
is a perennial plant and 
grows to a height of an 
inch or more. It is fairly 
common in the woods and 
damp meadows and i t carries 
athyrse of little pink flowers 
which blossom in May and 
June. The typical flower 
of our Orchids represents 
pretty closely the fantastic 
and yawning mouth of a 
Chinese dragon . The lower 
lip, which is very long and 
which hangs in the form of 
a jagged or dentate apron, 
serves as a landing-place 
for the insect. The upper 



-*- io4- 



lip rounds into a sort of 
hood, which shelters the 
essential organs ; while, be- 
hind the flower, beside the 
peduncle, there hangs a kind 
of spur or long, pointed 
horn, which contains the 
nectar. In most flowers, 
the stigma, or female organ, 
is a more or less viscid little 
tuft, which, at the end of 
a frail stalk, patiently awaits 
the coming of the pollen. 
In the Orchid, this tradi- 
tional installation has be- 
come irrecognizable. At 
the back of the mouth, in 
the place occupied in the 
throat by the uvula, are 
two closely-welded stigmas, 
above which rises a third 
stigma modified into an 



«£-io5-> 



extraordinary organ. At its 
top, it carries a sort of little 
pouch, or, more correctly, 
a sort of stoup, which is 
called the rostellum. This 
stoup is full of a viscid fluid 
in which soak two tiny balls 
whence issue two short 
stalks laden at their upper 
extremity with a packet of 
grains of pollen carefully 
tied up. 

Let us now see what hap- 
pens when an insect enters 
the flower. She lands on 
the lower lip, outspread to 
receive her, and, attracted 
by the scent of the nectar, 
seeks to reach the horn that 
contains it, right at the back. 
But the passage is purposely 
very narrow; and the insect's 



-s- io6~> 



head, as she advances, 
necessarily strikes the stoup . 
The latter, sensitive to the 
least shock, is at once rup- 
tured along a convenient 
line and lays bare the two 
little balls steeped in the 
viscid fluid. These, coming 
into immediate contact with 
the visitor's skull, fasten to 
it and become firmly stuck to 
it, so that, when the insect 
leaves the flower, she carries 
them away and, with them, 
the two stalks which rise 
from them,, and which end 
in the packets of tied-up 
pollen. We therefore have 
the insect capped with two 
straight, bottle-shaped 
horns. The unconscious 
artisan of a difficult work now 



-s- 107 -> 



visits a neighbouringflower. 
If her horns remained stiff, 
they would simply strike 
with their pollen-masses the 
other pollen-masses soaking 
in the vigilant stoup and no 
event would spring from the 
pollen mingling with pollen. 
But here the genius, the ex- 
perience and the foresight 
of the Orchid become ap- 
parent. The Orchid has 
minutely calculated the time 
needed for the insect to suck 
the nectar and repair to the 
next flower; and it has ascer- 
tained that this requires, on 
an average, thirty seconds. 
We have seen that the 
packets of pollen are carried 
on two short stalks inserted 
into the viscid balls. Now 



-*- io8-> 



at the point of insertion 
there is, under each stalk, 
a small membranous disc, 
whose only function is, at 
the end of thirty seconds, 
to contract and throw for- 
ward the stalks, causing 
them to curve and describe 
an arc of ninety degrees. 
This is the result of a fresh 
calculation, not of time, on 
this occasion, but of space. 
The two horns of pollen that 
cap the nuptial messenger 
are now horizontal and point 
in front of her head, so that, 
when she enters the next 
flower, they will just strike 
the two welded stigmas 
under the pendent stoup. 

This is not all and the 
genius of the Orchid has not 



-*-iog-3* 



yet expended all its fore- 
sight. The stigma which 
receives the blow of the 
pollen-packet is coated with 
a viscid substance. If this 
substance were as power- 
fully adhesive as that con- 
tained in the stoup, the 
pollen-masses, after their 
stalks were broken, would 
stick to it and remain fixed 
to it whole; and their des- 
tiny would be ended. This 
must not be ; it is important 
that the chances of the poll en 
should not be exhausted in 
a single venture, but rather 
that they should be multi- 
plied to the greatest possible 
extent. The flower that 
counts the seconds and 
measures the lines is a 



■*- IIO-> 



chemist to boot and distils 
two sorts of gum: one ex- 
tremely clingingand harden- 
ing as soon as it touches the 
air, to glue the pollen-horns 
to the insect's head; theother 
greatly diluted, for the work 
of the stigma. This latter 
is just prehensile enough 
slightly to loosen or disturb 
the tenuous and elastic 
threads with which the 
grains of pollen are tied 
up. Some of these grains 
cling to it, but the pollinic 
mass is not destroyed; and, 
when the insect visits other 
flowers, she will continue 
her fertilizing labours al- 
most indefinitely. 

Have I expounded the 
whole miracle ? No ; I have 



-S- III -§* 



still to call attention to many 
a neglected detail: among 
others, to the movement of 
the little stoup, which, after 
its membrane has been rup- 
tured to unmask the viscid 
balls, immediately lifts up 
its lower rim in order to 
keep in good condition, in 
the sticky fluid, the packet 
of pollen which the insect 
may not have carried off. 
We should also note the 
very curiously-combined 
divergence of the pollinic 
stalks on the head of the 
insect, as well as certain 
chemical precautions com- 
mon to all plants ; for the 
experiments made quite re- 
cently by M. Gaston Bonnier 
seem to prove that every 



■«*- 112 -3- 



flower, in order to preserve 
its species intact, secretes 
poisons that destroy or 
sterilize any foreign pollen. 
This is about all that we 
see; but here, as in all 
things, the real, the great 
miracle begins where our 
power of vision ends.

I have just this moment 
found, in an untilled corner 
of the olive-yard, a splendid 
sprig of Loroglossum hircinum, 
a variety which, for I know 
not what reason (perhaps 
it is very rare in England), 
Darwin omitted to study. 
It is certainly the most re- 
markable, the most fantastic, 
the most astounding of all 
our native Orchids. If it 
were of the size of the 
American Orchids, one 
could declare that there is 
no more fanciful plant in 
existence . Imagine a thyrse, 
like that of the Hyacinth, 
but a little taller. It is 
symmetrically adorned with 



-•s- n4-> 



ill-favoured, three-cornered 
flowers, of a greenish white 
stippled with pale violet. 
The lower petal, embellished 
at its source with bronzed 
caruncles, huge mustachios 
and sinister-looking lilac 
buboes, stretches out inter- 
minably, madly, unreally, 
in the shape of a corkscrew 
riband of the colour assumed 
by a drowned corpse after 
a month's immersion in the 
river. From the whole, 
which conjures up the idea 
of the most fearsome mala- 
dies and seems to blossom 
in some vague land of sar- 
donic nightmares and witch- 
eries, there issues a potent 
and abominable stench as 
of a poisoned goat, which 



-»S-Il5-> 



spreads afar and reveals the 
presence of the monster. I 
am pointing to and describ- 
ing this nauseating Orchid 
because it is fairly common 
in France, is easily recog- 
nized and adapts itself very 
well, by reason of its height 
and the distinctness of its 
organs, to any experiments 
that one might wish to make. 
We have only, in fact, to 
introduce the tip of a match 
into the flower and to push 
it carefully to the bottom of 
the nectary, in order, with 
the naked eye, to witness 
all the successive revolu- 
tions of the process of fer- 
tilization. Grazed in passing, 
the pouch or rostellum sinks 
down, exposing the little 



•+- n6-> 



viscid disc (the Loroglossum 
has only one) that supports 
the two pollen-stalks. As 
soon as this disc violently 
grips the end of the wood; 
the two cells that contain 
the pollen-balls open longi- 
tudinally; and, when the 
match is withdrawn, its tip 
is firmly capped with two 
stiff, diverging horns, each 
ending in a golden ball. 
Unfortunately, we do not 
here, as in the experiment 
with the Orchis latifolia, en- 
joy the charming spectacle 
offered by the gradual and 
precise inclination of the 
two horns. Why are they 
not lowered? We have but 
to introduce the capped 
match into a neighbouring 



+z-\ i7~> 



nectary to ascertain that this 
movement would be super- 
fluous, the flower being 
much larger than that of 
the Orchis maculata or latifolia 
and the nectar-horn ar- 
ranged in such a way that, 
when the insect laden with 
the pollen-masses enters it, 
they just reach the level of 
the stigma to be fertilized. 
Let us add that it is im- 
portant to the success of 
the experiment to select a 
flower that is quite ripe. 
We do not know when the 
flower is ripe; but the in- 
sect and the flower know, 
for the flower does not in- 
vite its necessary guests, 
by offering them a drop of 
nectar, until the moment 



+£- Il8-> 



comes when all its apparatus 
is ready to work. 

XVIII 

This is the basis of the sys- 
tem of fertilization adopted 
by the Orchid of our climes. 
But each species, every 
family modifies and im- 
proves the details in accord- 
ance with its particular 
experience, psychology and 
convenience. The Orchis or 
Anacamptis pyramidalis, for 
instance, which is one of 
the most intelligent, has 
added to its lower lip or 
labellum two little ridges 
which guide the proboscis 
of the insect to the nectar 
and compel her to accom- 



-*-ii9-> 



plish exactly what is ex- 
pected of her. Darwin very 
justly compares this ingen- 
ious accessory with the little 
instrument for guiding a 
thread into the fine eye of 
a needle. Here is another 
interesting improvement: 
the two little balls that carry 
the pollen-stalks and soak 
in the stoup are replaced by 
a single viscid disc, shaped 
like a saddle. If, following 
the road to be taken by the 
insect's proboscis, we insert 
the point of a needle or a 
bristle into the flower, we 
very plainly perceive the 
advantages of this simpler 
and more practical arrange- 
ment. As soon as the bristle 
touches the stoup, the latter 



-s-iao-s* 



is ruptured in a symmetrical 
line and uncovers the saddle- 
formed disc, which at once 
becomes attached to the 
bristle. Withdraw the 
bristle smartly and you will 
just have time to catch the 
pretty action of the saddle, 
which, seated on the bristle 
or needle, curls its two flaps 
inwards, so as to embrace 
closely the object that sup- 
portsit. The purpose of this 
movement is to strengthen 
the adhesive power of the 
saddle and, above all, to 
ensure with greater pre- 
cision than in the Orchis 
latifolia the indispensable 
divergence of the pollen- 
stalks. As soon as the 
saddle has curled round the 



•4-I2I-3* 



bristle and as the pollen- 
stalks planted in it, drawn 
apart by its contraction, are 
forced to diverge, the second 
movement of the stalks be- 
gins and they bend towards 
the tip of the bristle, in the 
same manner as in the 
Orchid which we have al- 
ready studied. These two 
combined movements are 
performed in thirty to 
thirty-four seconds. 



XIX 

Is it not exactly in this 
manner, by means of trifles, 
of successive overhaulings 
and retouches, that human 
inventions proceed? We 
have all, in the latest of our 



■*- 122-i- 



mechanical industries, fol- 
lowed the tiny, but constant 
improvements in the spark- 
ing, the carburation, the 
clutch and the speed-gear. 
It would really seem as 
though ideas came to the 
flowers in the same way as 
to us. The flowers grope 
in the same darkness, en- 
counter the same obstacles, 
the same ill-will, in the same 
unknown. They have the 
same laws, the same disil- 
lusions, the same slow and 
difficult triumphs. They 
would appear to possess our 
patience, our perseverance, 
our self-love, the same varied 
and diversified intelligence, 
almost the same hopes and 
the same ideals. They 



■•*- 123-f- 

I 



struggle, like ourselves, 
against a great indifferent 
force that ends by assist- 
ing them. Their inventive 
imagination not only fol- 
lows the same prudent and 
minute methods, the same 
tiring, narrow and winding 
little paths : it also has un- 
expected leaps and bounds 
that suddenly fix definitely 
an uncertain discovery. It 
is thus that a family of great 
inventors among the Or- 
chids, a strange and rich 
American family, that of the 
Catasetidse, thanks to a bold 
inspiration, abruptly altered 
a number of habits that 
doubtless appeared to it too 
primitive. First of all, the 
separation of the sexes is 



•*-I2/l-3» 



absolute : each has its par- 
ticular flower. Next, the 
pollinium, or mass or packet 
of pollen, no longer dips 
its stalk in a stoup full of 
gum, there awaiting, a little 
inertly and, in any case, 
without initiative, the lucky 
accident that is to fix it on 
the insect's head. It is bent 
back on a powerful spring, 
in a sort of cell. Nothing 
attracts the insect specially 
in the direction of this cell. 
Nor have the proud Catase- 
tidae reckoned, like the com- 
mon Orchids, on this or that 
movement of the visitor: a 
guided and precise move- 
ment, if you wish, but 
nevertheless a contingent 
movement. No, the insect 



-«S-I25~> 



no longer enters merely a 
flower endowed with an ad- 
mirable mechanism : she en- 
ters an animated and literally 
sensitive flower. Hardly 
has she pitched upon the 
magnificent outer court of 
copper-coloured silk before 
long and nervous feelers, 
which she cannot avoid 
touching, carry the alarm 
all over the edifice. Forth- 
with, the cell is torn asunder 
in which the pollen-mass, 
divided into two packets, is 
held captive on its bent-back 
pedicel, which is supported 
onabigvisciddisc. Abruptly 
released, thepedicelstraight- 
ens itself like a spring, drag- 
ging with it the two packets 
of pollen and the viscid disc, 



-*- ia6-> 



whi chare violently proj ected 
outside. In consequence of 
a curious ballistic calcula- 
tion, the disc is always flung 
first and strikes the insect, 
to whom it adheres. She, 
stunned by the blow, has 
but one thought: to leave 
the aggressive corolla with 
all speed and take refuge in 
a neighbouring flower. This 
is all that the American 
Orchid wanted.

Shall I describe also the 
curious and practical simpli- 
fications introduced into the 
general system by another 
family of exotic Orchids, the 
Cypripedese? Let us continue 



-S-I27-3- 



to bear in mind the circum- 
volutions of human inven- 
tions : we have here an 
amusing counter-proof. A 
fitter, in the engine-room, 
a preparator, a pupil, in the 
laboratory, says, one day, 
to his principal: 

" Suppose we tried to do 
just the opposite? Suppose 
we reversed the movement? 
Suppose we inverted the 
mixture of the fluids?" 

The experiment is tried; 
and, suddenly, from the 
unknown issues the unex- 
pected. 

One could easily believe 
the Cypripedese to have held 
similar conversations among 
themselves. We all know 
the Cypripedium, or Ladies'- 



-•*- 128-3- 



slipper: with its enormous 
shoe-shaped chin , its crabbed 
and venomous air, it is the 
most characteristic flower of 
our hothouses, the one that 
seems to us the typical Or- 
chid, so to speak. The 
Cypripedium has bravely 
suppressed all the compli- 
cated and delicate apparatus 
of the springy pollen-masses, 
the diverging stalks, the 
viscid discs, the cunning 
gums and the rest. Its clog- 
like chin and a barren, 
shield-shaped anther bar the 
entrance in such a manner 
as to compel the insect to 
pass its proboscis over two 
little heaps of pollen. But 
this is not the important 
point: thewholly unexpected 



-^iag"* - 



and abnormal thing is that, 
contrary to what we have 
observed in all the other 
species, it is no longer the 
stigma, the female organ that 
is viscid, but the pollen it- 
self, whose grains, instead 
of being pulverulent, are 
covered with a coat so gluti- 
nous that it can be stretched 
and drawn into threads. 
What are the advantages 
and the drawbacks of this 
new arrangement? It is to be 
feared that the pollen carried 
off by the insect may adhere 
to any object other than the 
stigma ; on the other hand, 
the stigma is dispensed from 
secreting the fluid destined 
to sterilize every foreign 
pollen. In any case, this 



~?-i3o-> 



problem would demand a 
special study. In the same 
way, there are patents whose 
usefulness we do not grasp 
at once. 



•«s-i3i-s- 



XXI 

To have done with this 
strange tribe of the Orchids, 
it remains for us to say a 
few words on an auxiliary 
organ that sets the whole 
mechanism going: I mean 
the nectary, which, for that 
matter, has been the object, 
on the part of the genius 
of the species, of enquiries, 
attempts and experiments as 
intelligent and as varied as 
those which are incessantly 
modifying the economy of 
the essential organs. 

The nectary, as we have 
seen, is, in principle, a sort 
of long spur, a long, pointed 
horn that opens right at the 



>+- l32-§«- 



bottom of the flower, beside 
the peduncle, and acts more 
or less as a counterpoise to 
the corolla. It contains a 
sugary liquid, the nectar, 
which serves as food for 
butterflies, beetles and other 
insects and which is turned 
into honey by the bee. Its 
business, therefore, is to 
attract the indispensable 
guests. It is adapted to 
their size, their habits, their 
tastes; it is always arranged 
in such a way that they can- 
not introduce or withdraw 
their proboscis without 
scrupulously and succes- 
sively performing all the 
rights prescribed by the 
organic laws of the flower. 
We already know enough 



-*-i33-> 



of the fantastic character 
and imagination of the 
Orchids to foresee that here, 
as elsewhere — and even 
more than elsewhere, for 
the more supple organ lends 
itself to this more readily — 
their inventive, practical, 
observant and groping spirit 
has given itself free scope. 
One of them, for instance, 
the Sarcanthus teretifolius, 
probably failing in its en- 
deavour to elaborate a viscid 
fluid that should harden 
quickly enough to stick the 
bundle of pollen to the in- 
sect's head, has overcome 
the difficulty by delaying 
the visitor's proboscis as 
long as possible in the 
narrow passages leading to 



•*- i34-> 



the nectar. The labyrinth 
which it has laid out is so 
complicated that Bauer, 
Darwin's skilful draughts- 
man, had to admit himself 
beaten and gave up the 
attempt to reproduce it. 

There are some which, 
starting on the excellent 
principle that every simpli- 
fication is an improvement, 
have boldly suppressed the 
nectar-horn. They have 
replaced it by certain fleshy, 
fantastic and evidently suc- 
culent excrescences which 
are nibbled by the insects. 
Is it necessary to add that 
these excrescences are al- 
ways placed in such a 
manner that the guest who 
feasts on them must inev- 



-s-i35-s«- 



itably set all the pollen- 
machinery in movement? 

XXII 

But, without lingering 
over a thousand very various 
little artifices, let us end 
these fairy stories by study- 
ing the enticements of the 
Coryanthes macrantha . Truly , 
we no longer know with 
exactly what sort of being 
we have to do. The as- 
tounding Orchid has con- 
trived this : its lower lip or 
labellum forms a sort of large 
bucket, into which drops of 
almost pure water, secreted 
by two horns situated over- 
head, fall continually ; when 
this bucket is half full, the 
water flows away on one 



-s- 136-> 



side by a spout or gutter. 
Allthishydraulicinstallation 
is very remarkable in itself; 
but here is where the alarm- 
ing, I might almost say the 
diabolical, side of the com- 
bination begins . The liquid 
which is secreted by the 
horns and which accumu- 
lates in the satin basin is 
not nectar and is in no way 
intended to attract the in- 
sects: it has a much more 
delicate function in the really 
machiavellian plan of this 
strange flower. The artless 
insects are invited by the 
sugary perfumes diffused 
by the fleshy excrescences 
of which I spoke above to 
walk into the trap. These 
excrescences are above the 



-s-i37-> 



bucket, in a sort of chamber 
to which two lateral open- 
ings give access. The big 
visiting bee — the flower, 
being enormous, allures 
hardly any but the heaviest 
Hymenopterse, as though the 
others experienced a certain 
shame at entering such vast 
and sumptuous halls — the 
big bee begins to nibble the 
savoury caruncles. If she 
were alone, she would go 
away quietly, after finishing 
her meal, without even graz- 
ing the bucket of water, the 
stigma and the pollen ; and 
none of that which is re- 
quired would take place. 
But the sapient Orchid ob- 
serves the life that moves 
around it. It knows that 



-•s- i38-> 



the bees form an innumer- 
able, greedyandbusypeople, 
that they come out by thou- 
sands in the sunny hours, 
that a perfume has but to 
quiver like a kiss on the 
threshold of an opening 
flower for them to hasten 
in a crowd to the banquet 
prepared under the nuptial 
tent. We therefore have 
two or three looters in the 
sugary chamber: the space 
is scanty, the walls slip- 
pery, the guests rough. 
They crowd and hustle one 
another to such good pur- 
pose that one of them always 
ends by fallinginto the bucket 
that awaits her beneath the 
treacherous repast. She 
there finds an unexpected 



•»s-i39-> 



bath, conscientiously wets 
her bright, diaphanous 
wings and, despite immense 
efforts, cannot succeed in 
resuming her flight. This 
is where the astute flower 
lies in wait for her. There 
is but one opening through 
which she can leave the 
magicbucket: the spout that 
acts as a waste-pipe for the 
overflow of the reservoir. 
It is just wide enough to 
allow of the passage of the 
insect, whose back touches 
first the sticky surface of 
the stigma and then the 
viscid glands of the pollen- 
masses that await her along 
the vault . She thus escapes, 
laden with the adhesive dust, 
and enters a neighbouring 



-s-i4o-> 



flower, where the tragedy 
of the banquet, the hustling, 
the fall, the bath and the 
escape is reenacted and per- 
force brings the imported 
pollen into contact with the 
greedy stigma. 

Here, then, we have a 
flower that knows and plays 
upon the passions of the in- 
sects. Nor can it be pre- 
tended that all these are 
only so many more or less 
romantic interpretations: 
no, the facts have been pre- 
cisely and scientifically 
observed and it is impos- 
sible to explain the use and 
arrangement of the flower's 
different organs in any other 
way. We must accept the 
evidence. This incredible 



■*- i4i -*■ 



and efficacious artifice is the 
more surprising inasmuch 
as it does not here tend to 
satisfy the immediate and 
urgent need to eat that 
sharpens the dullest wits; 
it has only a distant ideal 
in view: the propagation of 
the species. 

But why, we shall be 
asked, these fantastic com- 
plications which end only 
by increasing the dangers of 
chance? Let us not hasten 
to give judgment and reply. 
We know nothing of the 
reasons of the plant. Do 
we know what obstacles 
the flower encounters in 
the direction of logic and 
simplicity? Do we know 
thoroughly a single one of 



■*- 1^2 -*►. 



the organic laws of its ex- 
istence and its growth? One 
watching us from the height 
of Mars or Venus, as we 
exert ourselves to achieve 
the conquest of the air, 
might, in his turn, ask: 

"Why those shapeless 
and monstrous machines, 
those balloons, those air- 
ships, those parachutes, 
when it were so easy to 
copy the birds and to sup- 
ply the arms with a pair 
of all-sufficing wings?" 

XXIII 

To these proofs of intelli- 
gence, man's somewhat 
puerile vanity opposes the 
traditional objection: yes, 



-*- i43->- 



they create marvels, but 
those marvels remain eter- 
nally the same. Each 
species, each variety has 
its system and, from gen- 
eration to generation, in- 
troduces no perceptible 
improvement. It is quite 
true that, since we have 
been observing them — that 
is to say, during the past 
fifty years — we have not 
seen the Coryanthes macrantha 
or the Catasetidse perfect their 
trap : this is all that we 
can say; and it is really 
not enough. Have we as 
much as attempted the most 
elementary experiments; 
and do we know what the 
successive generations of 
our astonishing bathing 



-*-i44-> 



Orchid might do in a cen- 
tury's time, if placed in 
different surroundings, 
among insects to which it 
was not accustomed? Be- 
sides, the names which we 
give to the orders, species 
and varieties end by de- 
ceiving ourselves; and we 
thus create imaginary types 
which we believe to be fixed, 
whereas they are probably 
only the representatives of 
one and the same flower, 
which continues to modify 
its organs slowly in ac- 
cordance with slow cir- 
cumstances. 

The flowers came upon 
our earth before the insects ; 
they had, therefore, when 
the latter appeared, to adapt 



-§-i45-> 



an entirely new system of 
machinery to the habits of 
these unexpected collabora- 
tors. This geologically- 
incontestable fact alone, 
amid all that which we do 
not know, is enough to es- 
tablish evolution; and does 
not this somewhat vague 
word mean, after all, adap- 
tation, modification, intelli- 
gent progress? 

It would be easy, more- 
over, without appealing to 
this prehistoric event, to 
bring together a large num- 
ber of facts which would 
show that the faculty of 
adaptation and intelligent 
progress is not reserved 
exclusively for the human 
race. Without returning 



-»s-i46-3- 



to the detailed chapters 
which I have devoted to this 
subject in The Life of the 
Bee, I will simply recall two 
or three topical details which 
are there mentioned. The 
bees, for instance, invented 
the hive. In the wild and 
primitive state and in their 
country of origin, they work 
in the open air. It was the 
uncertainty, the inclemency 
of our northern seasons that 
gave them the idea of seek- 
ing a shelter in hollow trees 
or a hole in the rocks. 
This ingenious idea restored 
to the work of looting and 
to the care of the eggs the 
thousands of bees stationed 
around the combs to main- 
tain the necessary heat. It 



-s-i47-** 



is not uncommon, especially 
in the South, during excep- 
tionally mild summers, to 
find them reverting to the 
tropical manners of their 
ancestors. 1 

Another fact : transport 
our black bee to Australia 
or California and her habits 
will completely alter . Find- 
ing that summer is perpetual 
and flowers forever abun- 
dant, she will live, after 

1 1 had just written these lines, when M. E. L. 
Bouvier made a communication in the Academy 
of Science (cf. the report of the 7th of May 1906) 
on the subject of two nidifications in the open 
air observed in Paris, one in a Sophora Japonica, 
the other in a Horse Chestnut-tree. The latter, 
which hung from a small branch furnished with 
two almost contiguous forts, was the more re- 
markable of the two, because of its evident and 
intelligent adaptation to particularly difficult 
circumstances: 

"The bees," says M. de Parville, in his 
summary in the science-column of the Journal 
des Dibats of the 3ist of May 1906, "built 



*s-i48-3- 



one or two years, content 
from day to day to gather 
only sufficient honey and 
pollen for the day's con- 
sumption; and, her thought- 
ful observation of these new 
features triumphing over 
hereditary experience, she 
will cease to make provision 
for the winter. Biichner 
mentions an analogous fact, 
which also proves the bees' 
adaptation to circumstances, 
not slow, secular, uncon- 
scious and fatal, but im- 



consolidating pillars and resorted to really 
remarkable artifices of protection and ended by 
transforming the two forks of the chestnut-tree 
into a solid ceiling. An ingenious human being 
would certainly not have done so well. 

*' To protect themselves against the rain, they 
had installed fences, thickenings and blinds 
against the sun. One can have no idea of the 
perfection of the industry of the bees, except by 
observing the architecture of the two nidifica- 
tions, now at the Museum." 



-+- iAg-s* 



mediate and intelligent: in 
the Barbadoes, the bees 
whose hives are in the midst 
of the refineries, where they 
find sugar in plenty during 
the whole year, will entirely 
abandon their visits to the 
flowers. 

Let us lastly recall the 
amusing contradiction 
which the bees gave to two 
learned English entomolo- 
gists, Messrs. Kirby and 
Spence : 

" Show us," they said, "a 
single case where the pres- 
sure of events has inspired 
them with the idea of sub- 
stituting clay or mortar for 
wax or propolis; show us 
this and we will admit their 
capacity for reasoning." 



•«£-i5o-> 



Scarce had they forim> 
lated this somewhat arbi- 
trary wish, when another 1 
naturalist, Andrew Knight, 
having covered the bark 
of certain trees with a 
kind of cement made of 
wax and turpentine, dis- 
covered that his bees were 
entirely renouncing the col- 
lection of propolis and 
exclusively using this new 
and unknown matter, which 
they found in abundant 
quantities, ready prepared, 
in the vicinity of their 
dwelling. Moreover, in the 
practice of apiculture, 
when pollen is scarce, the 
bee-keeper has but to place 
a few handfuls of flour at 
their disposal for them at 



■*- i5i-3- 



once to understand that this 
can serve the same purpose 
and be turned to the same 
use as the dust of the an- 
thers, although its taste, 
smell and colour are abso- 
lutely different. 

What I have just said, 
in the matter of the bees, 
might, I think, mutatis 
mutandis, be confirmed in the 
kingdom of the flowers. I 
have referred above to my 
humble experiments in the 
wonderful evolutionary ef- 
forts of the numerous varie- 
ties of the Sage, which are 
worthy of a more methodical 
investigation. Meanwhile, 
among many other indica- 
tions that could easily be 
collected, I may mention 



-s- i5a~3- 



an interesting study by 
Babinet on the cereals, 
which tells us that certain 
plants, when transported 
far from their habitual cli- 
mate, observe the new 
circumstances and avail 
themselves of them, exactly 
as the bees do. Thus, in 
the hottest regions of Asia, 
Africa and America, where 
the winter does not kill it 
annually, our Corn becomes 
again what it must have 
been at first, a perennial 
plant, like grass . It remains 
always green, multiplies by 
the root and no longer bears 
ears or grains. When, 
therefore, from its original 
and tropical country, it came 
to be acclimatized in our 



-f-i53-s- 



icy regions, it must have 
had to upset its habits and 
invent a new method of 
multiplication. As Babinet 
well says: 

"The organism of the 
plant, thanks to an incon- 
ceivable miracle, seemed to 
foresee the need of passing 
through the grain state, lest 
it should perish completely 
during the severe season." 

XXIV 

In any case, to destroy 
the objection of which we 
spoke above and which has 
caused us to travel so far 
from our subject, it would 
be enough to establish one 
single act of intelligent pro- 
gress outside mankind. But, 



-*-i54-> 



apart from the pleasure 
which one takes in refuting 
an over-vain and out-of-date 
argument, how little impor- 
tance, when all is said, 
attaches to this question of 
the personal intelligence of 
the flowers, the insects 
or the birds ! Suppose that 
we say, speaking of the 
Orchid and the bee alike, 
that it is nature and not the 
plant or the fly that calcu- 
lates, combines, adorns, 
invents and thinks : what 
interest can this distinction 
have for us ? A much loftier 
question and one much 
worthier of our eager atten- 
tion towers over these de- 
tails. What we have to do 
is to grasp the character, 



■•$- i55-§- 



the quality, the habits and 
perhaps the object of the 
general intelligence whence 
emanate all the intelligent 
acts performed upon this 
earth. It is from this point 
of view that the study of 
those creatures — the ants 
and the bees, among others 
— in which, outside the 
human form, the processes 
and the ideal of that genius 
are most clearly manifested 
becomes one of the most 
curious that we can under- 
take. It appears, after all 
that we have shown, that 
those tendencies, those in- 
tellectual methods must be 
at least as complex, as ad- 
vanced, as startling in the 
Orchids as in the gregarious 



-*-i56-> 



Hymenopterae . Let us add 
that a large number of the 
motives and a portion of the 
logic of these restless in- 
sects, so difficult of obser- 
vation, still escape us, 
whereas we can grasp with 
ease all the silent motives, 
all the wise and stable 
arguments of the peaceful 
flower. 



-4-i57-> 



XXV 

Now what do we observe, 
when we perceive nature, 
the general intelligence or 
the universal genius (the 
name matters but little) at 
work in the Orchid world? 
Many things ; and, to men- 
tion it only in passing, for 
the subject would offer 
facilities for a long study, 
we begin by ascertaining 
that her idea of beauty, of 
gladness, her methods of at- 
traction, her aesthetic tastes 
are very near akin to our 
own . But no doubt it would 
be more correct to state 
that ours are congenial with 
hers. It is, in fact, very un- 
certain whether we have ever 



y- 



•*- i58-s*- 



invented a beauty peculiar 
to ourselves. All our archi- 
tectural, all our musical 
motives, all our harmonies 
of colour and light are bor- 
rowed directly from nature. 
Without calling upon the 
sea, the mountains, the 
skies, the night, the twi- 
light, what might one not 
say, for instance, of the 
beauty of the trees? I speak 
not only of the tree con- 
sidered in the forest, where 
it is one of the powers of 
the earth, perhaps the chief 
source of our instincts, of 
our sense of the universe, 
but of the tree in itself, the 
solitary tree, whose green 
old age is laden with a 
thousand seasons. Among 



-i-i59-> 



those impressions which, 
without our knowing it, 
form the limpid hollow and 
perhaps the subsoil of hap- 
piness and calm of our 
whole existence, which of 
us does not preserve the 
recollection of a few fine 
trees? When a man has 
passed mid-life, when he 
has come to the end of the 
wondering period, when 
he has exhausted nigh all 
the sights that the art, the 
genius and the luxury of 
ages and men can offer, 
after experiencing and com- 
paring many things he 
returns to very simple 
memories . They raise upon 
the purified horizon two or 
three innocent, invariable 



-§-i6o-s* 



and refreshing images, 
which he would wish to 
carry away with him in his 
last sleep, if it be true that 
an image can pass the 
threshold that separates our 
two worlds. For myself, I 
can imagine no paradise nor 
after-life, however splendid 
it may be, in which a certain 
magnificent Beech would be 
out of place, or a certain 
Cypress, or a Parasol Pine 
of Florence or of a charm- 
ing hermitage near my own 
house, any one of which 
affords to the passer-by a 
model of all the great move- 
ments of necessary resist- 
ance, of quiet courage, of 
soaring, of gravity, of silent 
victory and of perseverance.

But I am wandering too 
far afield: I intended only 
to remark, with reference 
to the flower, that nature, 
when she wishes to be 
beautiful, to please, to de- 
light and to prove herself 
happy, does almost what 
we should do had we her 
treasures at our disposal. 
I know that, speaking thus, 
I am speaking a little like 
the bishop who was as- 
tonished that Providence 
always made the great 
streams flow close to the 
big cities ; but it is difficult 
to look upon these things 
from any other than the 
human point of view. Let 



•*- 162-5- 



us, then, from this point of 
view, consider that we 
should know very few signs 
or expressions of happiness 
if we did not know the 
flower. In order well to 
judge of its power of glad- 
ness and beauty, one must 
live in a part of the country 
where it reigns undivided, 
such as the corner of Pro- 
vence, between the Siagne 
and the Loup, in which I 
am writing these lines. 
Here, truly, the flower is 
the sole sovereign of the 
hills and valleys. The peas- 
ants have lost the habit of 
cultivating corn, as though 
they had now only to pro- 
vide for the needs of a more 
subtle race of mankind that 



-s- 163- 



lived on sweet fragrance and 
ambrosia. The fields form 
one great nosegay, inces- 
santly renewed, and the 
perfumes that succeed one 
another seem to dance their 
rounds all through the azure 
year. Anemones, Gilli- 
flowers, Mimosas, Violets, 
Pinks, Narcissuses, Hya- 
cinths, Jonquils, Mignonette, 
Jasmine and Tuberoses in- 
vade the days, the nights, 
the winter, summer, spring 
and autumn months. But 
the magnificenthour belongs 
to the Roses of May. Then, 
as far as the eye can see, 
from the slope of the hills 
to the hollow of the plains, 
between dikes of Vines and 
Olive-trees, they flow on 



-s- i64-> 



every side like a stream of 
petals whence emerge the 
houses and the trees, a 
stream of the colour which 
we assign to youth, health 
and joy. The aroma, at 
once warm and fresh, but 
above all spacious, that 
opens up the sky emanates, 
one would think, directly 
from the sources of beati- 
tude. The roads, the paths 
are carved in the pulp of 
the flower, in the very sub- 
stance of Eden. For the 
first time in one's life, one 
seems to have a satisfying 
vision of happiness. 

XXVII 

Still from our human 
point of view and persevering 



*s- 165-> 



in the necessary illusion, 
let us add to our first re- 
mark one a little more ex- 
tensive, alittleless hazardous 
and perhaps big with con- 
sequences, namely, that the 
genius of the earth, which 
is probably that of the whole 
world, acts, in the vital 
struggle, exactly as a man 
would act. It employs the 
same methods, the same 
logic. It attains its aim by 
the means which we would 
use : it gropes, it hesitates, 
it corrects itself time after 
time ; it adds, it suppresses, 
it recognizes and repairs its 
errors, as we should do in 
its place. It makes great 
efforts, it invents with diffi- 
culty and little by little, 



-<- i66-s- 

after the manner of the 
engineers and artisans in 
our workshops. It fights 
like ourselves against the 
heavy, huge and obscure 
mass of its being. It knows 
no more than we do whither 
it is going ; it seeks and finds 
itself gradually. It has an 
ideal that is often confused, 
but one in which, neverthe- 
less, we distinguish a host 
of great lines that rise to- 
wards a more ardent, com- 
plex, nervous and spiritual 
form of existence. Materi- 
ally, it disposes of infinite 
resources, it knows the 
secret of prodigious forces 
of which we know nothing ; 
but, intellectually, it appears 
strictly to occupy our sphere : 



»j-i67-> 



we cannot prove that, hither- 
to, it has exceeded its limits; 
and, if it does not endeavour 
to take anything from be- 
yond that sphere, does this 
not mean that there is noth- 
ing outside it ? Does it not 
mean that the methods of 
the human mind are the 
only possible methods, that 
man has not erred, that he 
is neither an exception nor 
a monster, but the being 
through whompass, inwhom 
are most intensely mani- 
fested the great volitions, 
the great desires of the 
universe ? 

XXVIII 

The touchstones of our 
consciousness emerge 



*s-i68-> 



slowly, grudgingly. Per- 
haps Plato's famous figure 
is no longer sufficient: I 
mean the cave with the 
wall above it whence the 
shadows of unknown men 
and objects are thrown into 
the cave below; but, if we 
tried to substitute a new 
and more exact image in 
its place, this would be 
hardly more consoling. 
Suppose Plato's cave en- 
larged. No ray of bright- 
ness ever enters it. With 
the exception of light and 
fire, it has been carefully 
supplied with all that our 
civilization permits; and 
men have been imprisoned 
in it from their birth. They 
would not regret the light, 



■*- 169-*- 



having never seen it; they 
would not be blind, their 
eyes would not be dead, 
but, having nothing to look 
at, would probably become 
the most sensitive organ of 
touch. 

In order to recognize 
ourselves in their actions, 
let us picture these wretches 
in their darkness, in the 
midst of the multitude of 
unknown objects that sur- 
round them. What quaint 
mistakes, what incredible 
deviations, what astounding 
misinterpretations must 
needs occur! Buthowtouch- 
ing and often how ingenious 
would seem the use which 
they would make of things 
that had not been created 



-*- 170-3- 



for employment in the dark! 
How often would they guess 
aright? And how great 
would not be their stupe- 
faction if, suddenly, by the 
light of day, they discovered 
the real nature and purpose 
of utensils and furniture 
which they had accommo- 
dated as best they could 
to the uncertainties of the 
shade? 

And yet their position 
seems simple and easy com- 
pared with our own. The 
mystery in which they crawl 
is limited. They are de- 
prived of only one sense, 
whereas it is impossible to 
estimate the number of those 
in which we are lacking. 
The cause of their mistakes 



■*- I7I-S*- 



is one alone, whereas those 
of ours are countless. 

Since we live in a cave 
of this sort, is it not inter- 
esting to prove that the 
power which has placed us 
there acts often and on some 
important points even as we 
act ourselves? We thus 
obtain gleams of light in our 
underground cave to show 
us that we have not been 
mistaken as to the use of 
every object to be found 
therein ; and some of these 
gleams are brought to us 
by the insects and the 
flowers. 

XXIX 

We have long taken 
a rather foolish pride in 



<- 172-3- 



thinking ourselves miracu- 
lous, unparalleled and mar- 
vellously incidental beings, 
probably fallen from an- 
other world, devoid of any 
certain ties with the rest of 
life and, in any case, en- 
dowed with an unusual, 
incomparable, monstrous 
faculty. It is greatly pref- 
erable to be less prodigious, 
for we have learnt that prodi- 
gies do not take long to 
disappear in the normal evo- 
lution of nature. It is much 
more consoling to observe 
that we follow the same road 
as the soul of this great 
world, that we have the same 
ideas, the same hopes, the 
same trials and — were it not 
for our specific dream of 



■*• i73-> 



justice and pity — the same 
feelings. It is much more 
tranquillizing to assure our- 
selves that, to better our lot, 
to utilize the forces, the oc- 
casions, the laws of matter, 
we employ methods exactly 
similar to those which it 
uses to enlighten and order 
its unsubjected and uncon- 
scious regions, that there 
are no other methods, that we 
are in the midst of truth and 
that we are in our right place 
and at home in this universe 
formed of unknown sub- 
stances, whose thought, 
however, is not impenetrable 
and hostile, but analogous 
or apposite to our own. 

If nature knew every- 
thing, if she were never 



-*- 174-&- 



mistaken, if, everywhere, 
in all her undertakings, 
she showed herself perfect 
and infallible at the first on- 
set, if she revealed in all 
things an intelligence im- 
measurably superior to our 
own, then there would be 
cause to fear and to lose 
courage. We should feel 
ourselves the victims and 
the prey of an extraneous 
power, which we should 
have no hope of knowing 
or measuring. It is much 
better to be convinced that 
this power, at least from 
the intellectual point of 
view, is closely akin to our 
own. Our intelligence' 
draws upon the same re- 
serves as does that of nature. 



-*-i75-> 



We belong to the same 
world, we are almost equals. 
We are associating not with 
inaccessible gods, but 
with veiled and fraternal 
volitions, which it is our 
business to surprise and to 
direct. 

XXX 

It would not, I imagine, 
be very bold to maintain that 
there are not any more or 
less intelligent beings, but 
a scattered, general intelli- 
gence, a sort of universal 
fluid that penetrates di- 
versely the organisms which 
it encounters, according as 
they are good or bad con- 
ductors of the understanding. 
Man would then represent, 



■*- 176-J- 



until now, upon this earth, 
the mode of life that offered 
the least resistance to this 
fluid, which the religions 
called divine. Our nerves 
would be the threads along 
which this more subtle elec- 
tricity would spread. The 
circumvolutions of our brain 
would, in a manner, form 
the induction-coil in which 
the force of the current 
would be multiplied; but 
this current would be of no 
other nature, would proceed 
from no other source than 
that which passes through 
the stone, the star, the flower 
or the animal. 

But these are mysteries 
which it is somewhat idle to 
question, seeing that we do 



-*-i77-*- 



not yet possess the organ 
that could gather their re- 
ply. Let us be satisfied 
with having observed certain 
manifestations of this in- 
telligence outside ourselves. 
All that we observe within 
ourselves is rightly open to 
suspicion : we are at once 
judge and suitor and we 
have too great an interest 
in peopling our world with 
magnificent illusions and 
hopes. But let the slightest 
external indication be dear 
and precious to us. Those 
which the flowers have just 
offered us are probably quite 
infinitesimal compared with 
what the mountains, the sea 
and the stars would tell us, 
could we surprise the secrets 



-*- 178-i- 



of their life. Nevertheless, 
they allow us to presume 
with greater confidence that 
the spirit which animates 
all things or emanates from 
them is of the same essence 
as that which animates our 
bodies. If this spirit re- 
sembles us, if we thus re- 
semble it, if all that it 
contains is contained also 
within ourselves, if it em- 
ploys our methods, if it has 
our habits, our preoccupa- 
tions, our tendencies, our 
desires for better things, is 
it illogical for us to hope 
all that we do hope, instinc- 
tively, invincibly, seeingthat 
it is almost certain that it 
hopes the same? Is it 
probable, when we find 



-+- 179 "*" 



scattered through life so 
great a sum total of intelli- 
gence, that this life should 
makenoworkof intelligence, 
that is to say, should not pur- 
sue an aim of happiness, of 
perfection, of victory over 
that which we call evil, 
death, darkness, annihila- 
tion, which is probably only 
the shadow of its face or its 
own sleep?
